## 1.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 1324104: Migrating package to @changesets namespace

  Ownership of the repository has moved from https://github.com/s0/ghcommit
  to https://github.com/changesets/ghcommit. As part of this we're also moving the
  NPM package to the @changesets namespace. No functional changes have happened,
  so this can be a drop-in replacement for `@s0/ghcommit`.
